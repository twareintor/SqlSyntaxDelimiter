# SqlSyntaxDelimiter
SQL syntax delimiter (getting the keywords, special characters, comments, texts/ values etc) inside a text representing a SQL query

A simple C program in a single file as a starting point to a highlighter, comment elliminator, keywords and syntax check for SQL strings.

NOTE: There is no syntax highlighter for SQL in MsAccess, for example. Every Excel document can be turned into a powerful database - the query string can be stored into a worksheet but the formatting and highlighting are a tedious work. Copying a highlighted text into Excel cell is (as long I know) not possible. The solution: a highlighter.
